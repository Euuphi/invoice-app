## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Create, read, update, and delete invoices
-   Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
-   Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
-   Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

-   [Implementing Dark Theme](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/implementing-a-dark-theme-toggle-with-react-redux-and-styled-components-e637c4d41e2f) - This helped me to implement a dark theme toggle using react redux and styled components.
-   [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
